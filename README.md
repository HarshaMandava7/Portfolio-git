This repository houses a combination of HTML and PHP files, with a special emphasis on creating a responsive Contact page, Feel free to explore and Contribute to This Repo
I want my Contact page to be Responsive which can take input/Feedback from the user So I decided To Use Php(PhpMailer) Which helps to Work on Mails 
When users provide feedback or reach out via the contact form, their messages are delivered directly to my email inbox and  workings of this feature can be explored in Contact_Prcess.php You can explore that file 
To ensure easy access and interaction with my portfolio, I've hosted it using the INFINITYFREE web hosting service.
